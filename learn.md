## Guides and tutorials

The Reactors.IO step-by-step guide explains the concepts in the framework in detail.
It is the best way to get started.
There is also the FAQ section, which quickly covers some important concepts.

    Event streams and related event-based programming abstractions
    are described in this paper.
    At the time the paper was written,
    event streams used to have the <code>Reactive[T]</code> type
    (now represented with the <code>Events[T]</code> type).
    Observers used to have the type <code>Reactor[T]</code>
    (now represented with the <code>Observer[T]</code> type).
    This was changed in the Reactors.IO 0.6 version.
